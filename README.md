# CMOS-Buffer-Energy-Delay-Optimization
This project focuses on the design and optimization of a three-stage CMOS buffer driving a capacitive load CL​=50⋅Cin​. The goal is to identify and validate the Pareto Frontier within the Energy-Delay design space using technological characterization, Monte Carlo simulations, and analytical optimization.
